1.  The Anatomy class is totally undefined, and is never filled with
data.

2.  The polymorphic pointers like Diffusion* in the Simulate class and
Conductivity* in the diffusion classes should be wrapped in a
templatized goody so that the default copy constructor, destructor, etc
will just work.

3.  It would really be better if the fibre orientation angles were
converted to a double (radians) when they are read in and the
conductivity models don't have to worry about the conversion.

4.  The grid spacing (in mm) appears to be read from input.  Shouldn't
this travel with the anatomy data?


6.  There is output in FibreConductivity.cc that isn't screened for rank

9.  Do something about the long comment in Conductivity.hh

10.  Initialization of Voltages

13.  Base classes need virtual destructors

14.  The process of creating a HaloExchange from a GridRouter involves a
great deal of copying data.  This could be improved.

15.  I really don't like the way the Simulate class is turning out.  In
particular the fact that it owns things like GridRouter and
HaloExchange<double> voltageExchange that can't be easily initialized in
the constructor is a problem.

16.  There is way too much conversion from gids to tuples going on.
Should think about the right time to ditch the gids and just store
tuples.

17.  We allow multiple stimulus objects, but if two objects happen to
stimulate the same cell the last guy wins.  Is this what we want?  Also,
if stimuli are additive we need to zero the external stimulus every time
step.


18.  The conductivity classes don't know anything about cell type.  In
BlueBeats there are explicit checks to make sure that we're only
computing conductivities for tissue cell.

19.  The system for using the JHU model for conductivities isn't the
same as in BlueBeats.  In BB we use a parameter on the anatomy reader
(sort of) to determine whether to read the angles.  Here, we need to set
the type of the CONDUCTIVITY object.  Should there be some kind of magic
system that turns on the JHU model if the fiber angles can't be found?

20.  There is a fudge factor of 1e-5 added to the radius of a domain
in GridRouter when determining whether a cell is inside the domain.  I'd
feel better if there was a meaningful length scale attached to the fudge.

22.  The size of the simulation cell is stored in both Simulate and
Anatomy.  This is trouble waiting to happen.

23.  Why does the PointListSensor have a collection of pointers to
streams instead of just a collection of streams?  With just streams we
don't need a non-default destructor.

24.  What are reasonable defaults for the printRate and evalRate of a
Sensor?

25.  It might be nice if the ActivationTimeSensor had a printrate in ms
instead of timesteps.  What about the other print/eval rate functions?
should they be in steps or in msec?

26.  We're going down the road of making all of the Sensors depend on
the cell order in the Anatomy.  Do we want to think about rebuilding all
of the Sensors if the Anatomy changes?

27.  How is the PointListSensor's output organized?  Should we use
snapshot directories?  Should each Sensor go in its own special purpose
directory?

28.  Loop count is currently an int.  Do we need to make it long long?

29.  Figure out arch dependent build stuff.  In particular, the code
that is inherited from ddcMD has some expectations about what the
-D$(ARCH) macros should look like and I don't think we're doing the righ
thing at present

30.  I'm not sold on the checks for zero valued elements of the
conductivity tensor in the computation of the diffusion weights.

31. The decomposition is setup by two functions: assignCellsToTasks and
getRemoteCells.  Right now both scan the DECOMPOSITION object.  Perhaps
these should be brought together somehow.

32. Why does the PointListSensor have a vector of pointers to streams
instead of just a vector of streams?

33.  The loadState function in TT06_RRG_Reaction silently ignores
unknown fieldsName.  It also merrily goes about its way when not all of
the variables that are possible to set are in the BucketOfBits.

34.  The way we have structured the loading of restart files all of the
data gets tokenized twice.  Once in the cell model when the cell state
is extracted from the BucketOfBits and a second time when the simulation
loop gets the membrane voltage.  If this turns out to be a performance
bottleneck we can instead store each record in tokenized form (or
perhaps store the token offsets) when we constrcut the BucketOfBits

35.  The CommTable class as revised by Changhoan leaks memory when
destroyed.  (_offsets)

36.  SPI causes problems with the former design that the remote data was
appended to the local data and appeared to be a single array.  This is
especially acute for the membrane voltage.

37.  sigmaLi and sigmaTi are probably crappy choices for keywords since
they likely evoke bi-domain concepts.

38.  There are at least four places in the code where the name of the
snapshot directory is constructed.  We should call a common function.

39.  The pio library will choke on checkpoint files where any one of the
physical files contains no data.  The cause of the crash will be the
assert(read_len > 0) at line 671 (r1825).  We should think through very
carefully what will happen if a file has no data and how to be sure that
case is properly supported.

40.  The intrinsic vec_ld won't accept a const double* as an argument.
If it did we could throw quite a few more consts into the calc
function.  Mostly these were removed in r403 to get the code to compile.

41.  FGR diffusion leaks since it does not delete fgrBarrier_.  I'd
really prefer not to have a raw pointer sitting around.  First I'll need
to get the fast barrier stuff better designed.

42.  The snapshotCellList_ and coarsedata_ members *must* be removed
     from the Simulate class.

43.  The place where we call posix_memalign aren't sensitive to the
     actual simd length.

44.  The handling of the number of files for pio output is not
adequate.  Each Popen should probably do something inteligent.  Perhaps
Pclose should reset the default.  The fact that the number of files
isn't a class member is an even bigger problem.

45.  The nGlobal member of Anatomy probably isn't a very good idea.
nRemote has problems too since any change to the cell Array can change
nRemote without actually resetting the class value.  Anatomy is an
easy class to screw up.

46.  The handling of the nDiffusionCore return value from the
assignment code completely messes up the ability to set diffusion and
reaction thread by thread.  This needs to be cleaned up.  I'm in too
much of a hurry right now.
